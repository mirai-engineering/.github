## 👨‍💼 Leadership

**Bruno Copa** — CEO & Founder

Bruno pioneered the use of artificial neural networks in combustion engineering long before the AI revolution. With a **B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Engineering from RWTH Aachen University**, he has led transformative AI projects at **Airbus, AVL, Porsche, Cariad**, and collaborated with **MIT**. His vision: AI as a tool to enhance human productivity while preserving the unique abstraction capabilities that define human intelligence.

> _"Artificial Neural Networks are the second most powerful form of intelligence we've encountered—just after human intelligence. AI should enhance our productivity, not replace our ability to understand the world's foundations."_

---

## 🌍 Our Mission & Vision

### Mission
To **demystify artificial intelligence** and make it transparent and accessible to everyone. We cut through the complexity and noise surrounding AI, empowering organizations to harness its true potential while maintaining ethical responsibility.

### Vision
Bridge the gap between AI's potential and its practical implementation. We envision a future where experience meets realistic expectations, where organizations can seamlessly integrate AI into their operations without confusion.
